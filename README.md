# 2022 Scientific Computing Intro

At long last I've managed to make this repo work! Somehow I has way too many old versions of R and gcc installed on my computer and at some point in the course somehow I couldn't even run R code without getting some weird errors. Some scripts (11 and 12) still only seem to work for me on RStudio Cloud, but reviewing each class and doing this caffeine-induced commit train was worth it in th end.

## Project structure

```
project/
*    ├── data/
*    │   ├── raw
*    │   └── processed
     ├── docs/
*    ├── figs/
     ├── R/
*    ├── output/
*    └── README.md
```
In the `R` directory you will find the scripts. Let's start using R!
